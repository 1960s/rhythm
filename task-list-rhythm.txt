collecting resources for rhythms resource, look at how to write a book and document content.
have a requirement for rhythms such as one instrument only and pop music, use billboard hit songs or children's songs in category traditional and folk music

wide tuning, multiple voices near pitch
layer instruments slightly flat and sharp, to cover up flaws of equal temperment, sweeping under the rug
certain instruments are better at playing chords and scales,
countering the effects of equal temperment, how instrument is strummed to remove potentially inharmonic notes of equal temperment
you can overdub notes for just intonation work
ex. twang vs feathery might be better at minor scales and playing chords in a way to reduce onvertones that don't exist in scale.
bending on the guitar, bending on chords, compensate equal temperament

underlying scales in tones as pulse is to rhythm
dividing tones from root to octave into divisuble tones. ex, 12 tones or 16 tones or 8
then make ratios to create melody and chords, similar to pulse in rhythm groups

// rhythmic oddity = even pulse rhythms where opposite always 0 when 1.
    //can also measure degree of rhythmic oddity, pulses / 2 is least value
    // oddity is dependent on composition grouping also necklace.
//offbeatness = counter of 1's that land on offbeat indexes
//complementary rhythms = inverse rhythms played together, must be even pulses
    //homometric rhythms = the inverse is a rotation of the original
Divisive rhythm versus additive rhythm
music notation as sustained vs single note

//rhythms that have less than half the number of beats to rhythms
most likely a quarter + 1, ex 8 pulse is 3 beats, 16 pulse is 5 beats

	Equivalent tones when rhythm is sped up, perfect 5th is a 2:3 polyrhythm or 6 pulses = 2112 


RHYTHM FILTER & VISUALIZER
use breakbeat book ethan hein
	can make strong and weak patterns, note groupings
	change notation
	counting custom
	color coding instruments, bass hi hat snare trumpet
	make a slider for quick filter
	can bold counting for shortest notation 1 is bold -e -+ -a
	bass and snare and silence for 3 variables red white and blue or custom colors, custom can be problem
	syllable in sounds, consonants and vowel possible, tih tah tih teh tah boo ho
	make an adjustable rhythm for different mathematical ratios, silver ratio,
	visual tree structure of rhythms
	visual rhythm book https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number
	Custom boxes for counting methods, 1 e and a can be tik a tok a
	Sticking types first, can't do all sticking, too many outcomes, for 8 pulse left and right are 256 combos
	standard such as paradiddles and paradiddlediddles
	Searchable rhythms

RHYTHM PROFILER & WORKOUT SESSIONS

make into updateable pwa, use as desktop app gets updated

	Safi al-Din al-Urmawi
	his book of Rhythms : Risalah al-Sharafiyah fi al-Nisab al-Ta'lifiyyah
	list rhythms specifics by space and time and genre.


use popular music
show which instrument is using rhythm and is percussion name the instruments used such bass/snare or hi/bass or bass
if instrument is vocals, then you can input string of syllables which then gets placed on each of 1's in rhythm
ex, 110100 110100 1000 is equal to  I like dirt I like dirt I like
chromeextension vs pwa, pwa gets updated but is removed with a clear browsing data.
list upsides and downsides on website 

have explanation metadata on catalog and what your output will look like.
Have this done on a form and you can upload pictures to create a new page for content.
